*What is the URL of your Google Colab notebook?*
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1woE7VVMMLExtLpLeW4WQFKuyniSziIgq?usp=sharing


## Python/Seaborn

*Insert the first penguin chart here*

*Describe what the figure is showing.*
From the above Bar Graph in comparision with Adelie and Chinstrap we can say that the body mass in Gento is greater which is approximately 5000 where as Adelie and Chinstrap has approximately 3000 body mass. 

*Insert the second penguin chart here*

*Describe what the figure is showing.*
The above graph represents the information about bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm in X-Axis and Y-Axis respectively. And bill_length_mm ranges between 35 to 60 where as bill_depth_mm ranges between 14 to 20.

*What happened when you removed the outer parentheses from the code? Why?*
The code we changed was removing the y-axis of the chart which is vl.y().fieldN("Origin") so we can only able to see the x-axis which is the count of records.


## Observable and Vega-Lite

*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`?*
markCircle() is used to mark or highlight something as circle shape where as markSquare() is used to mark or highlight something as square shape.

*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markPoint()`?*
markCircle() represents the highlighted part in a circle, where as markPoint() represents the highlighted part in small circles and can be used for customer representation also.

*What change do you need to make to swap the x and y axes on the scatterplot?*
3 vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower") vl.y().fieldQ("Miles_per_Gallon") should be replaced by vl.y().fieldQ("Horsepower") vl.x().fieldQ("Miles_per_Gallon") to swap the x and y axes.

*Insert the bar chart image here*

*Why do you think this chart is the result of this code change?*
Because of the change in the code y-axis is missing which is vl.y().fieldN("Origin"), we can only see this x-axis which shows the record count.
