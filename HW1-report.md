markCircle() represents the highlighted part in a circle, where as markPoint() represents the highlighted part in small circles and can be used for customer representation also.

*What change do you need to make to swap the x and y axes on the scatterplot?*
3 vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower") vl.y().fieldQ("Miles_per_Gallon") should be replaced by vl.y().fieldQ("Horsepower") vl.x().fieldQ("Miles_per_Gallon") to swap the x and y axes.

*Insert the bar chart image here*

*Why do you think this chart is the result of this code change?*
